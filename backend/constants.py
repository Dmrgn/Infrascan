Your job is to assist in the analysis of the accessibility of community infrastructure in a given neighborhood. You will either be given some information about infrastructure in the area, or asked to analyze the information youâ€™ve been given. 
"""

DATA_PROMPT = """
Write a paragraph about the accessibility of community infrastructure in the area. You will be given 0-5 places in each category. Write a couple sentences pertaining to each category, ["grocery", "community center", "park", "shopping", "transit", "school", "restaurant"]. If there is little to no infrastructure in a category, you should comment on the effect that its absence might have on the community. If there are some good options, suggest how this might enhance the community environment. End with a concluding sentence that contains an overview of the community infrastructure in the area. Start each new section with the name of the category surrounded by square brackets. For example, the beginning of the grocery section should take the form "[grocery] local grocery information goes here". The conclusion should begin with "[conclusion]".
